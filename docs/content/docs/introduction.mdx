Maksud UI is a collection of more opinionated shadcn/ui components built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It consists of most of the components in shadcn/ui and some additional components that are not.

## Thinking process behind Maksud UI

Dice UI is a collection of fully composable components that extend shadcn/ui. These components are accessible and customizable to fit your needs. Dice UI is copy-paste ready, no complex setup or configuration required.
Every component follows WCAG guidelines, includes proper ARIA attributes, and supports keyboard navigation out of the box.
